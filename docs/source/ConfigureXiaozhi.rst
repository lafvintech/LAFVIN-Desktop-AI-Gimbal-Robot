QFA For Xiaozhi Configure

- If the device does not show a `Xiaozhi-xxxx` hotspot, press the **RST** button again to restart Wi-Fi configuration mode and wait for the board to finish booting.
- If the configuration page does not redirect automatically after connecting to the hotspot, open a browser and navigate manually to `http://192.168.4.1`.
- If your Wi-Fi network is not listed, use the manual entry option to type the SSID and password exactly, including uppercase letters and symbols.
- If the device fails to connect to Wi-Fi, confirm the password, ensure the router supports 2.4 GHz, and avoid hidden or enterprise networks during initial setup.
- If the 6-digit pairing code is not accepted during device binding, verify the code shown on the screen and try again after refreshing the console page.
- If the AI assistant responds incorrectly or does not respond, re-check the role prompt and settings, then press **RST** on the main control panel to reload the configuration.

For any persistent issues, refer to the Xiaozhi documentation and support resources, or retry the setup steps from the beginning to confirm each stage was completed correctly.
